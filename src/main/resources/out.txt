recorded in his diary: ‘But I am attempting to complete my work [on
the revisions] – I cannot leave it while it is all in my mind. So much
time has been wasted in all my work by this constant breaking of
threads.’ This was the last major set of revisions Tolkien himself
made to the text during his lifetime. They were added to the second
impression (1967) of the three-volume hardcover Allen & Unwin
second edition. The revisions themselves mostly include corrections
of nomenclature and attempts at consistency of usage throughout the
three volumes. Some small alterations were made by Tolkien in the

Britain by the London firm George Allen & Unwin on 29 July 1954;
an American edition followed on 21 October of the same year, published by Houghton Mifflin Company of Boston. In the production
of this first volume, Tolkien experienced what became for him a
continual problem: printer’s errors and compositor’s mistakes, including well-intentioned ‘corrections’ of his sometimes idiosyncratic
usage. These ‘corrections’ include the altering of dwarves to dwarfs,
elvish to elfish, further to farther, nasturtians to nasturtiums, try and say
to try to say and (‘worst of all’ to Tolkien) elven to elfin. In a work
such as The Lord of the Rings, containing invented languages and
delicately constructed nomenclatures, errors and inconsistencies

that copies had been issued without proof having been read by the
author, never became known to Tolkien; while his publisher, Rayner
Unwin, learned of it only thirty-eight years after the fact. Tolkien
found a few of the unauthorized changes introduced in the second
printing when (probably while preparing the second edition in 1965)
he read a copy of the twelfth impression (1962), but thought the
errors newly made. These, among others, were corrected in the course
of the reprinting. Then in 1992 Eric Thompson, a reader with a keen
eye for typographic detail, noticed small differences between the first

next stage of textual evolution came about to allow for a greater
uniformity of the text in all future editions, but with it, inevitably,
came new wrinkles. Some new misreadings entered into the text,
while at the same time others were fixed. In the worst instance, one
line of the ring inscription in the chapter ‘The Shadow of the Past’ of
The Fellowship of the Ring was simply dropped. Unforeseeable glitches
arose in other editions when the base computerized text was transferred into page-making or typesetting programs – e.g., in one edition
of The Fellowship of the Ring, the closing two sentences of ‘The Council
of Elrond’ simply and inexplicably disappeared. Such glitches have

earliest materials what is very much a children’s book, a sequel to
The Hobbit, and as the story grows through various ‘phases’, there is
an increase in seriousness and depth. We see alternate branches of
development, the gradual blending and merging of certain characters,
and the slow emergence of the nature of the rings and of the motivations of other characters. Some of these various ideas are abandoned
altogether, while others are reworked into some variant form that
may or may not survive into the final version.
One could make a whole catalogue of interesting tidbits from
Christopher Tolkien’s study – such as the fact that Strider was called

Middle-earth (1996), covers the evolution of the prologue and appendices to The Lord of the Rings. These volumes contain an engrossing
over-the-shoulder account of the growth and writing of Tolkien’s
masterpiece.
The process of studying Tolkien’s manuscripts of The Lord of the
Rings involved the deciphering of versions where Tolkien wrote first
in pencil and then in ink atop the pencilled draft. Christopher Tolkien
has decribed his father’s method of composition in The Return of the
Shadow: ‘In the handwriting that he used for rapid drafts and
sketches, not intended to endure long before he turned to them again

------------------------------------------------------------------------
the authorial process itself at work in such detail. Tolkien’s hastiest
comments about where the story might proceed, or why it can or
can’t go such and such a way – these queries to himself were written
out: Tolkien is literally thinking on paper. This gives an added dimension of understanding to Tolkien’s comment to Stanley Unwin in a
1963 letter that, when suffering from trouble with his shoulder and
right arm, ‘I found not being able to use a pen or pencil as defeating
as the loss of her beak would be to a hen.’ And we, as readers
of these volumes, can share with Tolkien himself the wonder and
bewilderment of new characters appearing as if from nowhere, or of

of these volumes, can share with Tolkien himself the wonder and

their emergence into the story.
I know of no other instance in literature where we have such a

of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems
now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less
hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following
years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead. Or to take
a less grievous matter: it has been supposed by some that ‘The Scouring of the Shire’ reflects the situation in England at the time when I
was finishing my tale. It does not. It is an essential part of the plot,
foreseen from the outset, though in the event modified by the character of Saruman as developed in the story without, need I say, any

So many new emendations to The Lord of the Rings, and such an
extensive review of its text, deserve to be fully documented. Although
most readers will be content with the text alone, many will want to
know more about the problems encountered in preparing this new
edition, and their solutions (where solutions have been possible),
especially where the text has been emended, but also where it has
not. To this end, and to illuminate the work in other respects, we
are preparing a volume of annotations to The Lord of the Rings for

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many of the emendations in the present text are to marks of
punctuation, either to correct recent typographical errors or to repair
surviving alterations introduced in the second printing of The Fellowship of the Ring. In the latter respect and in every case, Tolkien’s
original punctuation is always more felicitous – subtle points, when
one is comparing commas and semi-colons, but no less a part of the
author’s intended expression. Distinctive words such as chill rather
than cold, and glistered rather than glistened, changed by typesetters
long ago without authorization, likewise have been restored. A
controlled amount of regularization also seemed called for, such as

Five; and there as the beacons flared in Ano´rien and The´oden came

for thought.
It was during 1944 that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of
a war which it was my task to conduct, or at least to report, I forced
myself to tackle the journey of Frodo to Mordor. These chapters,
eventually to become Book Four, were written and sent out as a
serial to my son, Christopher, then in South Africa with the RAF.

Efforts such as these follow the example of the author of The Lord
of the Rings during his lifetime. His concern for the textual accuracy
and coherence of his work is evident from the many emendations he
made in later printings, and from notes he made for other emendations which for one reason or another have not previously (or have
only partly) been put into effect. Even late in life, when such labours
wearied him, his feelings were clear. On 30 October 1967 he wrote

story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight
them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them. As a
guide I had only my own feelings for what is appealing or moving,
and for many the guide was inevitably often at fault. Some who have
read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it boring,
absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to complain, since I
have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that
they evidently prefer. But even from the points of view of many who
have enjoyed my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps

deeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, the Necromancer, the Ring. The discovery of the significance of these glimpses
and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the Third Age
and its culmination in the War of the Ring.
Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition of
The Lord of the Rings went on at intervals during the years 1936 to
1949, a period in which I had many duties that I did not neglect,
and many other interests as a learner and teacher that often absorbed
me. The delay was, of course, also increased by the outbreak of war
in 1939, by the end of which year the tale had not yet reached the
