he wrote of it: ‘confusing (as it does) real personal matters with the
‘‘machinery’’ of the Tale, is a serious mistake’. Tolkien also added
an extension to the prologue and an index – not the detailed index
of names promised in the first edition, but, rather, a bald index
with only names and page references. Additionally, at this time the

Tolkien received his copies of the Ballantine edition in late January
1966, and in earlyFebruary he recorded in his diary that he had ‘worked
for some hours on the Appendices in Ballantine version & found more
errors than I at first expected’. Soon after this he sent a small number
of further revisions to Ballantine for the appendices, including the
now well-known addition of ‘Estella Bolger’ as wife of Meriadoc in
the family trees in Appendix C. Most of these revisions, which entered
variously in the third and fourth impressions (June and August 1966)

wrote, concerning the revising of The Lord of the Rings, that perhaps he
had failed to keep his notes in order; this errant branch of revision
forced to reset the appendices using the copy as published in the first
Ballantine edition. This did not include Tolkien’s second, small set
of revisions sent to Ballantine; but, more significantly, it did include
a great number of errors and omissions, many of which were not
discovered until long afterwards. Thus, in the appendices, a close

After the initial printings of this edition, which bore a 1966 copyright
notice, the date of copyright was changed in 1965 to match the statement in the Ballantine edition. This change has caused a great deal
of confusion for librarians and other researchers who have tried to
sort out the sequence of publication of these editions.
Meanwhile, Tolkien spent much of the summer of 1966 further
sort out the sequence of publication of these editions.
Meanwhile, Tolkien spent much of the summer of 1966 further
revising the text. In June he learned that any more revisions were too
late for inclusion in the 1966 Allen & Unwin second edition, and he
recorded in his diary: ‘But I am attempting to complete my work [on
the revisions] – I cannot leave it while it is all in my mind. So much
made to the text during his lifetime. They were added to the second
impression (1967) of the three-volume hardcover Allen & Unwin

of nomenclature and attempts at consistency of usage throughout the
three volumes. Some small alterations were made by Tolkien in the

J.R.R. Tolkien died in 1973. His third son and literary executor,
Christopher Tolkien, sent a large number of further corrections of
misprints, mainly in the appendices and index, to Allen & Unwin
for use in their editions in 1974. Most of these corrections were
typographical, and in line with his father’s expressed intent in his
or from later versions can prove perfectly opaque after long examination; and if, as he often did, he used a soft pencil much has now
become blurred and faint.’ The true difficulty of reading such doubledrafts can be observed in the frontispiece to The War of the Ring,
which reproduces in colour Tolkien’s illustration of ‘Shelob’s Lair’
from a page of Tolkien’s manuscript. Looking very closely at the
hasty ink draft alongside the illustration, one can see underneath
it the earlier, hastier, pencilled draft. Also in The War of the Ring,
xi
T HE L ORD O F THE R INGS
Christopher Tolkien reproduces a page from the first manuscript of
the chapter ‘The Taming of Sme´agol’, and the printed text corresponding to this text is on the facing page (see pp. 90–91). One is
astonished at anyone’s ability to decipher such texts.
That difficulty aside, just what do these books signify to ordinary
readers and to Tolkien scholars? And what is ‘the history of the
writing’ of a book? Simply, these volumes show in great detail the
development of the story of The Lord of the Rings from its very earliest
drafts and hasty projections through its completion. We see in the
earliest materials what is very much a children’s book, a sequel to
The Hobbit, and as the story grows through various ‘phases’, there is
an increase in seriousness and depth. We see alternate branches of
development, the gradual blending and merging of certain characters,
and the slow emergence of the nature of the rings and of the motivations of other characters. Some of these various ideas are abandoned
altogether, while others are reworked into some variant form that
may or may not survive into the final version.
One could make a whole catalogue of interesting tidbits from
Christopher Tolkien’s study – such as the fact that Strider was called
Trotter until a very late stage in the writing of the book; that Trotter
was at one time a hobbit, so named because he wore wooden shoes;
that Tolkien at one point considered a romance between Aragorn
and Eowyn; ´ that Tolkien wrote an epilogue to the book, tying up
loose ends, but it was dropped before publication (and now appears
in Sauron Defeated); and so on. But these developments are best
appreciated when read within the context of Christopher Tolkien’s
commentary rather than discussed separately.
The most significant achievement of these volumes is that they
show us how Tolkien wrote and thought. Nowhere else do we see
the authorial process itself at work in such detail. Tolkien’s hastiest
comments about where the story might proceed, or why it can or
can’t go such and such a way – these queries to himself were written
out: Tolkien is literally thinking on paper. This gives an added dimension of understanding to Tolkien’s comment to Stanley Unwin in a
1963 letter that, when suffering from trouble with his shoulder and
right arm, ‘I found not being able to use a pen or pencil as defeating
as the loss of her beak would be to a hen.’ And we, as readers
of these volumes, can share with Tolkien himself the wonder and
bewilderment of new characters appearing as if from nowhere, or of
some other sudden change or development, at the very moment of
their emergence into the story.
I know of no other instance in literature where we have such a
‘history of the writing’ of a book, told mostly by the author himself,
with all the hesitations and false paths laid out before us, sorted out,
xii
N OT E O N TH E TE XT
commented upon, and served up to a reader like a feast. We are
shown innumerable instances in the minutest detail of the thoughtprocess itself at work. We see the author fully absorbed in creation
for its own sake. And this is all the more exceptional because this
is a history not only of the unfolding of a story and its text, but of
the evolution of a world. There is an additional wealth of material
beyond simple narrative text. There are maps and illustrations. There
are languages and writing systems, and the histories of the peoples
who spoke and wrote in these systems. All of these additional
materials add multiple dimensions of complexity to our appreciation
of the invented world itself.
Fifty years into the published life of The Lord of the Rings, it seems
extraordinary to me that we have not only such a masterful work of
literature but also as a companion to it an unparalleled account of
its writing. Our gratitude as readers goes to both of the Tolkiens,
father and son.

NOTE O N THE 5 0 T H ANNIVERSARY
EDITION
In this edition of The Lord of the Rings, prepared for the fiftieth
anniversary of its publication, between three and four hundred emendations have been made following an exhaustive review of past
editions and printings. The present text is based on the setting of
the HarperCollins three-volume hardcover edition of 2002, which in
turn was a revision of the HarperCollins reset edition of 1994. As
Douglas A. Anderson comments in the preceding ‘Note on the Text’,
each of those editions was itself corrected, and each also introduced
new errors. At the same time, other errorssurvived undetected, among
them some five dozen which entered aslong ago as 1954, in the resetting
of The Fellowship of the Ring published as its ‘second impression’.
That the printer had quietly reset The Fellowship of the Ring, and
that copies had been issued without proof having been read by the
author, never became known to Tolkien; while his publisher, Rayner
Unwin, learned of it only thirty-eight years after the fact. Tolkien
found a few of the unauthorized changes introduced in the second
printing when (probably while preparing the second edition in 1965)
he read a copy of the twelfth impression (1962), but thought the
errors newly made. These, among others, were corrected in the course
of the reprinting. Then in 1992 Eric Thompson, a reader with a keen
eye for typographic detail, noticed small differences between the first
and second impressions of The Fellowship of the Ring and called them
to the attention of the present editors. About one-sixth of the errors
that entered in the second printing quickly came to light. Many more
were revealed only recently, when Steven M. Frisby used ingenious
optical aids to make a comparison of copies of The Lord of the Rings
in greater detail than was previously accomplished. We have gladly
made full use of Mr Frisby’s results, which he has generously shared
and discussed.
In the course of its fifty-year history The Lord of the Rings has had
many such readers who have recorded changes made between its
various appearances in print, both to document what has gone before
and to aid in the achievement of an authoritative text. Errors or
possible errors were reported to the author himself or to his publishers, and information on the textual history of the work circulated
among Tolkien enthusiasts at least as early as 1966, when Banks

Mebane published his ‘Prolegomena to a Variorum Tolkien’ in the
fanzine Entmoot. Most notably in later years, Douglas A. Anderson
has been in the forefront of efforts to achieve an accurate text of The
Lord of the Rings (and of The Hobbit); Christina Scull has published
‘A Preliminary Study of Variations in Editions of The Lord of the
Rings’ in Beyond Bree (April and August 1985); Wayne G. Hammond
has compiled extensive lists of textual changes in J.R.R. Tolkien: A
Descriptive Bibliography (1993); and David Bratman has published an
important article, ‘A Corrigenda to The Lord of the Rings’, in the
March 1994 number of The Tolkien Collector. The observations of
Dainis Bisenieks, Yuval Kfir, Charles Noad, and other readers, sent
to us directly or posted in public forums, have also been of service.
Efforts such as these follow the example of the author of The Lord
of the Rings during his lifetime. His concern for the textual accuracy
and coherence of his work is evident from the many emendations he
